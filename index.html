You see this is a tale that goes back ages ago. There were once these two young lads in painting? Class and they didn't know each other so well. THEN THIS EVIL LADY NATASHA tried to corrupt them with her wicked ways. These two young lads became warriors! And fought off the wicked natasha and saved all of camp! (P.S Don't tell natasha I said this she'll kill me) May you one day rise to the greatness that is me. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE SECOND BESTEST PERSON IN DA WHOLE WIDE WORLD YA SWOOSH<br><br><br>
